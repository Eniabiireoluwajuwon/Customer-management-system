# Customer-management-system
# The program starts with a list of existing customers.
# You can add new customers to the system.
# The program checks if the new customer already exists in the list of existing customers.
# If the new customer is found in the existing customer list, it sets the detail variable to True.
# If the new customer is not found in the existing customer list, it adds the new customer to the list.
# After processing, the program prints the updated list of existing customers.
